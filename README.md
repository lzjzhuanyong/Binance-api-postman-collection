- Select the `Environments` tab on the left, choose an environment, and set your Api Key and Secret Key by changing the `Current Value` column (see screenshot);
(The `Timestamp`, `nonce`, `Signature`, `Initial Value` fields can be left empty as theyâ€™ll be automatically filled by Postman when sending a request.)

## Postman safety practices
The following practices are advised to secure your account's safety:

- Don't use Collections obtained from an unknown source.
- Review the environment JSON file before its usage.
- Don't use any code that you don't understand.
- Make sure that the withdrawal permission **is not enabled** for your API keys.
- When you finish trying out the API, delete your API keys.
